	Right now we're magnifying periodic motion that's about
	<span class='hz number'></span>
	with attenuation factor
	<span class='times number'></span>.
	We're magnifying things smaller than 
	<span class='proportion number'></span>
	between
	<span class='small number'></span>
	and
	<span class='big number'></span>
	times, and magnifying everything bigger than that
	<span class='biggest number'></span>
	times. <span class='instructions'>Drag the blue circles on the graph to change the effect!</span>

  <h1>What is this?</h1>
  <p>
    In Fall 2014, I took <b>Bill Freeman</b> and <b>Antonio Torralba</b>'s class <a href="" title="MIT people use obscure decimals instead of, y'know sane course titles and newspeakian portmanteaus">6.869: Advances in Computer Vision</a> with my friend Kevin Kwok.
    For our final project, we were supposed to implement some variation of one of the algorithms which were covered in class. We decided to implement <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/">Eulerian Video Magnification</a> in the browser, to see if it could work with a live webcam feed. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If you wanna learn more about details of the algorithm, or check out the exciting sequels they've worked on. Check out the <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/">original 2012 paper</a> or  the 2013 <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/nwadhwa/phase-video/"> phase-based technique</a>.
  </p>
  <h1 >Wat? <span>What's Video Magnification?</span></h1>
  <p>
    It's sort of like being <b>Superman</b> and having <b>X-Ray vision</b>. It's about being able to see things that wee ordinary people can't, because the changes are <b>too small to notice</b>. But rather than being like a microscope, which just <b>blows everything up</b>, it lets you appreciate subtle change at the original spatial scale. 
  </p>
  <h1 >How does it work? </h1>
  <p>Like everything you've ever known and loved, Eulerian Video Magnification is built on a lie. It's a bit of an optical illusion because while it <i>looks</i> like things are moving more, the pixels aren't actually shifting around. </p>
